# SARAH
Framework for quickly building multi user apps using PHP, jQuery and SASS.  The backend currently supported is Apache2, PHP5, and MySQL.

## Notes
I would like to move the backend to Nginx and MariaDB (if not postgres).  OpenJDK is also used for some server side tasks, the goal will be to migrate those to Node.
